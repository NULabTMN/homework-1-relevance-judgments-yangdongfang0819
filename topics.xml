	<text>WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.-
When the honorary commercial commissioners 
of Japan arrive in Washington, November 1, they will be taken on an automobile ride which will include Potomac drive, 
along which 2000 cherry trees to be presented to this country by the emperor of Japan are to be planted.
The shipment of the trees and the planting thereof have been entrusted to Torakiro Watase, Tokio plant company, 
who is one of the commissioners. Speaking of the gift of the emperor to the city of Washington, Mr. Watase
said the trees would be sent to Mrs. Taft, wife of the president, and presented by her to the government 
for transplanting along Potomac drive. Former President Roosevelt and President Taft are chiefly 
responsible for the improvement of the Potomac river front, and it was Mrs. Taft who gave the name Potomac park 
to that section of the city. She made popular the afternoon promenades on the drive, which were a feature last year of 
summer life in the capital. New York Remembered The emperor of Japan is sending to New York also a large number 
of cherry trees to be planted along Riverside drive and Grant's tomb. In Japan, the land of the blossom, there are many 
beautiful legends about the trees and the flower of the cherry. The blossom of the Japanese cherry is of a peculiarly delicate 
beauty, and there is a tradition in Japan that if that same tone appears in the blossoms of the Japanese cherry planted 
in another country, that country can be taken and subjugated by Japan.
Mr. Watase is authority for the statement that while many Japanese cherry trees have been brought to the United States, 
the color of the blossoms, although just as beautiful, is unlike the blossom which appears in Japan."Therefore," 
he said, "we conclude that we could not take America, even if we wanted to."</text>

	<text>Our new Potomac Park, down beyond the monument, 
is to be beautified by Japanese cherry trees. Col. Cosby, Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds,
has been informed by Jukio Ozaki, the Mayor of Tokyo, Japan, that the 2,000 cherry trees which were presented to the city of Washington,
have arrived at Seattle, and will be shipped at once to this city. The Mayor of Tokyo said in his letter: "It gives me great
pleasure to inform you that the corporation of Tokyo,at a recent meeting of its Councils, resolved to present 2,000 Japanese
cherry trees to the Government of the United States for the use of the city of Washington." And the Mayor goes on to say:"The cherry
trees are extensively cultivated in this country, and are the most admired of the flowering trees. Ten of the most 
representative kinds have been selected, and I beg to assure you that it will remain to the citizens of Tokyo a pleasing memory, 
as well as a matter of civic pride, to know that their small offering will be permitted to contribute to the advancement 
of the beautiful Capital of the admire great Republic which they all admire</text>

	<text>Japanese Cherry Trees Presented to Mrs. Taft 
The Emperor of Japan's remembrance of President Taft's great enjoyment of the cherry blossom festival season when 
in Japan has taken the graceful form of the presentation to Mrs. Taft of three carloads of young cherry trees, 
and they are now in Washington. The greatest care has been taken all the way from the land of the Mikado to keep the
temperature at an even stage so that the trees may not be harmed. Mrs. Taft, in appreciation of the opportunity for a 
cherry blossom season at the National Capital, has instructed the delivery of the trees to the District Commissioners, 
and rows of them lining Pennsylvania Boulevard will be a beautiful feature of that imposing thoroughfare.</text>

	  <text>Gifts from Tokyo to Washington Found To Be Badly Diseased
Washington, Jan. 28—Regret has been expressed by the President and by Mrs. Taft because two thousand Japanese cherry trees, 
presented by the municipality of Tokyo to this government for use in the national capital, have been found to be infected with
root gall worms, certain diseases, and insect pests, some of which were hitherto unknown in this country.
The trees were to have been planted in Potomac Park, which Mrs. Taft worked hard last year to make into an outdoor boulevard and 
meeting place for social Washington. The Secretary of Agriculture found it necessary to recommend the destruction of the trees. 
Secretary Knox has expressed to the Japanese Ambassador the regret of the government authorities that the gift cannot be used. 
Colonel Cosby, in charge of Public Buildings and Grounds, has conveyed the government's regrets to the Mayor of Tokyo.</text>

	<text> It will be remembered that the Emperor of Japan last Spring sent several thousand Japanese cherry trees to Mrs.Taft 
to be placed along the Potomac Drive, which she originated. These cherry trees were found to be infected with a peculiar 
injurious Japanese insect, and for fear they would contaminate the cherry trees in this country the whole lot was burned.
It is now announced that the Japanese authorities are sending another consignment of cherry trees that have been examined and 
shown to be clear of all disease. </text>

	  <text>CHERRY TREES ON THE WAY 
Long Delayed Japanese Gift to City Soon to Arrive
The long-awaited cherry trees, which the Japanese government offered to present to this city at the time of the Hudson-Fulton celebration,
will be here in a few days. The consignment, which includes 2,100 young cherry trees, arrived last week in Seattle and is now being shipped 
to this city over the Great Northern Railroad. Park Commissioner Stover said yesterday that he had written to the Department of Agriculture 
in Washington to send a man here to examine the trees to make sure that no ruinous tree disease was being imported at the same time.
In explaining the delay of the trees, the Park Commissioner said the first trees prepared for shipment were found to have a blight.
"Then the Japanese authorities promised to have these trees reach here just about this time," said the Commissioner, "which shows the 
calculating powers of the Japanese."The problem of where to plant such a number of trees is bothering the Commissioner. Charles D. Lay, 
the landscape architect, has been asked to prepare plans at once, because it will be necessary to plant the trees as soon as the weather is favorable.
The Japanese, interested in the placement of the trees, want many of them planted around Grant's Tomb. Last winter, a bronze tablet,
on which was engraved a scene of Grant's Tomb surrounded by the cherry trees, was presented by Japanese citizens, 
and it is taken as indicating where at least some of them must go to meet the expectations of the donors. </text>

	<text> Mikado's Gift to United States Forms Avenue of Delicate Beauty 
Blossoms Signal the Passage of Time
In all the riot of blossoms that have burst forth in Potomac Park within the last week, making that tract the most gorgeous anywhere 
in the District, there is none that shows more delicate beauty than the blooms on the Japanese cherry trees, which were presented to 
the United States by the government of Japan a year ago. These fragrant, beautiful trees are blooming this year for the first time. 
The river drive, from the Virginia bridge up to Twenty-sixth Street, is fragrant with them, and thousands have stopped their carriages 
to admire the delicacy and beauty of the blooms. Unlike other cherry varieties, the Japanese variety leans more towards blooming than 
fruit-bearing. The chief strength of the trees seems to be spent in putting forth the wonderful clusters of blossoms which cover the limbs. 
The trees have been planted for just a little more than a year and, of course, have not yet obtained any beauty in terms of symmetry. 
The pruning knife has not yet had the opportunity to work toward symmetry, and the branches spread awkwardly beside the main stem.
Blossoms Are Beautiful The blossoms, however, are as beautiful now as they will be in years to come and make the observer forget the 
shape of the tree. In appearance, the blooms are a delicate pink, shading almost to white in some instances. Each cluster is made up of dozens 
of individual blossoms, which are formed somewhat like the wild rose. A little over a year ago, the Department of Agriculture received a 
consignment of several hundred cherry trees from Japan. One of the shipments was found to be infected with scale disease, and, for fear that 
a new tree plague might spread from the District, the heads of the department considered destroying the whole lot of several hundred trees. 
Closer inspection disclosed that the trees affected were in the minority, and, after removing the affected ones, the remainder were planted.
The original intention was to plant the cherry trees all over the District of Columbia. However, after the scale was discovered, 
the plan was changed, and the trees were planted along the riverbank in Potomac Park. In this location, they are practically segregated, 
and, if the scale develops further, it will be a relatively simple matter to keep the disease in a restricted area until it is eradicated.</text>

	  <text>GLIMPSE OF NIPPON NEAR TIDAL BASIN 
Japan has come to the United States—just a little slice of the Flowery Kingdom, to be sure—but enough to make even the most unimaginative 
person long to see cherry blossom time in Nippon.Down at the Tidal Basin, on the other side of the Monument, a display of Japanese cherry trees 
is in full and fragrant bloom—blooms that are trying to merge with all their delicate pinkness and sweetness to announce that spring is here, 
that they live but to weave garlands for her costumes and wreaths for her hair. Yesterday, every member of the Japanese embassy made a pilgrimage 
to the cherry trees from their far-away country. They stood in wonder and delight at the sight of the flowers they love so well. It was like being 
transported back to Japan—for a few happy moments, they said. But it’s only a glimpse of what Japan really looks like, they declared, for in their country, 
the trees are less than a bit smaller than our trees, although not a whit less lovely. The climate here is good for the fall blooming of the Japanese trees.
The cherry trees came straight from Japan several years ago and found a home in this country. What could be more appropriate for a dwelling place 
than the National Capital, and what more delightful and easily accessible location than around the Tidal Basin? So they were planted, 
took deep root and life, and every spring will display more profuse and lovely charms. It was the city of Tokyo, through the mayor, 
that made it possible for Washingtonians to have a glimpse of Japan as it looks in the soft, beautiful springtime, 
which has been the inspiration of many lovers. Thousands of maidens pledge their troth under the cherry blossoms, 
demonstrating that American boys and girls can hold hands under the same trees that have inspired young couples in faraway Japan.</text>

	<text> Washington Hasn't The Only Japanese Cherries
As lovely as any Japanese cherry tree that blossoms in Washington, is the opinion of hundreds of people who have ridden out 
West Main Street during the past two weeks to view a Japanese cherry tree in full bloom in the yard of the Howard Kramers.
The tree in question is large and beautifully formed, and the yield of blossoms is luxurious. It came into bloom about two weeks ago.</text>

	<text> Just to the south of that spacious plot upon which man's genius has reared an architecturally "new Washington," old Mother Nature 
is transcending his achievement in the creation of beauty. Quietly she goes about her task of renewing life in the most famous group of ornamental trees 
in the Western Hemisphere. These are the Japanese cherry blossom trees, which border Potomac Park, whose edges are skirted by the sleepy river that gives it a name.
They are now bursting forth in a vast, billowy cloud of pink and white buds, which constitute the crowning glory of Washington in springtime.
Unaffected by the massive grandeur of the new temples set geometrically in the great green garden of the Mall, the cherry blossom scene is ready for the 
annual obeisance of hundreds of thousands. At the height of its glory at Eastertide, it will welcome President and potentate, prince and peasant—the great and 
small—whose ranks are augmented every year as the fame of the trees widens. When the final count is taken, Washington's annual Cherry Blossom 
Festival is expected to rival the inaugural in the size of the multitude it attracts to the city. Of all the recurring fêtes to which the Nation lends its attention, 
this one stands unique in its character of spontaneity.</text>

	<text> GIFT FROM JAPAN
I am sure most of you know that the famous cherry trees, whose blossoms attract thousands of visitors to Washington around Easter time each year, 
were a gift to the United States from the citizens of Tokyo, Japan. There are about 3,000 of these trees. They were sent to Washington in two shipments, 
one in 1909 and the other in 1912. The first shipment had to be destroyed, as an inspection by the Department of Agriculture disclosed that the trees 
were infested with insects. The second group was found to be healthy and was planted around the Tidal Basin and elsewhere in Potomac Park.</text>

	  <text> Cherry Blossom Festival
Spring is a few weeks away in Washington. It is a sure sign when the city bestirs itself in preparation for the annual Cherry Blossom Festival. 
As in the past, a considerable number of Southeastern Ohioans will be present among the thousands of visitors who will make the journey to their Nation's Capital.
This is a civic celebration sponsored by the city of Washington. The Government does not participate except to the extent that special hospitality is 
shown to visitors sightseeing in their capital city. The blossoming cherry trees were a gift from Japan in 1912. 
The Festival was inaugurated as an annual event in 1927. </text>

	<text>WASHINGTON, June 2
Other weddings there have been at the White House, but never before has a President of the United States been married there. From the very dawn of the wedding day, 
the city seemed alive to the approaching event. Little knots of idlers talked it over on the sidewalks in front of hotels; sedate matrons gossiped as they 
passed along the streets, and bevies of laughing girls chatted and speculated about it. If there be truth in the ancient adage, a happy bride will reign in the White House. 
For though the day opened with a gray and cheerless sky and shadows resting on the earth, as it grew older, the elements seemed to relent.
Little by little, the sun forced its rays through the unwilling clouds until its broad beams fell in generous abundance on the soft green sward of the 
trim park encompassing the White House, bringing out in high relief the stately white columns of the time-honored home of Presidents, 
sparkling on the spray of the fountains, and gilding the foliage of the grand old trees.</text>

	<text>THE VETO PRESIDENT
President Cleveland is entitled to the appellation of the veto president. His record as the vetoer of bills is unsurpassed, although he has only completed a 
little more than fifteen months of his term. It has been urged that the veto power reposed in the president is a dangerous feature in our organic law, as it places too much
power in the hands of one man, which, if used arbitrarily, could be exercised to the detriment of the public interests. It is true that Congress has the right, 
by a two-thirds vote, to pass a bill over the president's veto, and that this fact to a certain extent answers the objection to the veto power.
At the same time, there are instances, such as the rush of business immediately preceding the adjournment of Congress, when it would be next to impossible to 
get a vote on a vetoed bill, and thus the president would be master of the situation. However objectionable the veto feature may be, it cannot be urged 
against President Cleveland that he has abused this power, notwithstanding the frequency with which he has been called upon to use it. The people are with him in this matter.
The public treasury has been tapped so often, and so nearly exhausted by the multiplicity of private bills which have squeezed through Congress by one crook or another, 
that the country is gratified to see a check placed on this extravagant system of legislation. As long as the president continues to exercise the same 
judicious discrimination that he has shown up to this time, he can keep right along with the veto. Twenty-nine vetoes in one day is a good record,
but if it takes 229 per day to check congressional extravagance, we hope the president will pile them in. </text>

	<text>CLEVELAND'S LAST VETO
Returns the Drought Relief Seed Bill to the House Without His Approval
Senators and Representatives Wish to Aid the Farmers
Washington, Feb. 16—The President has vetoed the bill appropriating $10,000 for the distribution of seeds to the drought-stricken counties of Texas.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS
Washington, Feb. 16—The following is the message from the President vetoing the bill for the distribution of seeds in Texas:
To the House of Representatives:
I return without my approval House bill No. 10,203, entitled "An act to enable the Commissioner of Agriculture to make a special distribution of seeds in the 
drought-stricken counties of Texas and make an appropriation therefor."It is represented that a long, continued, and extensive drought has existed in certain 
portions of the state of Texas, resulting in the failure of crops and consequent distress and destitution. Though there has been some difference in the 
statements concerning the extent of the people's needs in the localities thus affected, there seems to be no doubt that there has existed a condition calling for relief.
I am willing to believe that, notwithstanding the aid already furnished, the donation of seed grain to the farmers located in this region to enable 
them to put in new crops would serve to avert a continuation of this unfortunate blight. Yet, I feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan proposed
by this bill. To indulge a benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds for that purpose, 
I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended 
to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner related to the public service or benefit.</text>

	<text>HIS FIRST DAY
Cleveland Well Received at the Capital City - Sensational Rumors
Special to the Globe
Washington, March 3—The safe arrival of President-elect Cleveland at an early hour this morning gave great satisfaction, not because any serious consequences 
were apprehended, but because it afforded relief that the presidential party had escaped all possible mishaps of travel, accident, and injury of any character.
Alarmists spread the report that cranks had threatened President Cleveland's life, and the police authorities of New York deemed their information sufficiently 
reliable to warrant the closest surveillance of his person and of suspected individuals for the past week or more. The police authorities of Washington have also been 
on the lookout for the same length of time and cooperated with the New York and Albany officials in this effort. Up to an early hour this morning, 
when the actual arrival of President-elect Cleveland became known, it was the opinion of many shrewd persons that he had been smuggled into the city yesterday evening 
and quietly isolated in private quarters. His declining to receive any entertainment today from President Arthur is commented upon as somewhat unusual, 
but the general opinion is that he acted wisely and was influenced solely by a desire not to occupy President Arthur's time and attention at a period when 
the latter was engrossed by immediate and pressing business, further than to pay a visit of ceremony. Altogether, his demeanor today 
is commended on all sides, and, notwithstanding the natural anxieties surrounding the event, his first day in Washington has been received positively. </text>

	<text> Princeton, N. J., June 25
The body of Grover Cleveland, president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897, lies today in his home here, Westland,
awaiting interment tomorrow in the family plot in the cemetery here beside the remains of his dearly beloved first-born child, Ruth.
The arrangements for the funeral have not been made public, with only the time, 5 p.m., having been given out. President Roosevelt has 
announced his intention of being present. His was one of the first messages of condolence received by Mrs. Cleveland. The funeral will be private 
in deference to her wishes. Telegrams of condolences have come in by the hundreds from all parts of the United States and other countries.
Very few of these, however, were read by Mrs. Cleveland, who decided not to attempt to learn their contents until she has recovered from the shock caused by her husband's death.
Among those who telegraphed or cabled their condolences were Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks, Governor Charles E. Hughes of New York, Judge Alton B. 
Parker of New York, American Ambassador to Great Britain Whitelaw Reid, Admiral Robley D. Evans, Judge George Gray of Delaware, and Mayor George B. McClellan of New York.
Mr. Cleveland's death occurred so unexpectedly that not one of his four children was at home. The children were at the Cleveland summer home at Tamworth, N. H.,
under the care of Mrs. Perrine, Mrs. Cleveland's mother. Word was sent to them of their father's death. The children are Esther, aged fourteen; Marion, aged twelve; 
Richard, aged ten; and Francis Grover, aged five. Only two of the Cleveland children, Esther and Richard, will attend the funeral and will come here with 
Mrs. John H. Finley, wife of President Finley of New York City College. Marion and Francis will remain at Tamworth with Mrs. Perrine.</text>

	<text>Probably Met at Aurora
For many years, Mrs. Cleveland has taken the deepest personal interest in the welfare of her alma mater. She was graduated from Wells College in June 1885, 
just one year before her marriage to Mr. Cleveland at the White House on June 2, 1886. One year later, she was elected alumni trustee of the institution, 
and her activity in its affairs has been continuous. It was thought that her friendship with Prof. Preston ripened during her many visits to Aurora. Mrs. Cleveland 
was born in Buffalo on July 2, 1864. After her father’s death, Mr. Cleveland became the executor of his estate and the guardian of his daughter.
Soon after Mr. Cleveland entered the White House, their engagement was announced, and the marriage followed on June 2, 1886. It was a simple and very quiet ceremony.
Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland went to Deer Park, Maryland, for their honeymoon. There was widespread public interest in the first White House wedding since the marriage of Nellie Grant, 
and Mrs. Cleveland won admiration for the poise she showed in a trying position for such a young woman. She made herself universally liked as a hostess in the White House and 
enhanced her popularity with the American public when her first daughter was born. By a turn of political fortune, the second child, Esther, was born while Cleveland was in office. 
Marion was born on July 7, 1895; Richard, on October 1897; and Francis Grover, on July 17, 1903. Ruth Cleveland died in Princeton on January 7, 1904.</text>

	<text> The Marriage
Washington, June 1—The President and Miss Folsom were duly married this evening. About 6:30 p.m., the wedding guests began to arrive, 
their carriages rolling up to the main door of the mansion through the great iron gates on Pennsylvania Avenue. The first arrival was Secretary Lamar, 
closely followed by Rev. Dr. Sunderland and his wife. During the next few minutes, there came in quick succession Postmaster General Vilas and his wife, Mr. Willson S. Bissell, 
Secretary and Mrs. Endicott, Secretary Bayard, Secretary and Mrs. Whitney, and Secretary Manning and his wife. After removing their wraps in the state dining room, 
all of the guests proceeded to the blue room, where they were received by Miss Rose Cleveland. For a few minutes, the guests chatted gaily, 
but the conversation was quickly suspended at 7:15 p.m., when the selected orchestra from the Marine Band, stationed in the corridor, struck up the 
familiar strains of the wedding march from Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and all eyes were turned to the doorway to catch the first glimpse of the couple. </text>

	<text>Lake Success—Secretary General Trygve Lie, it was revealed here this week, was the man behind the choosing of Dr. Ralph J. Bunche to head the U.N. Secretariat,
which will prepare the Holy Land for partition. Dr. Bunche, a 43-year-old, California-educated African American, impressed Lie with his work last summer in Palestine as a 
leading adviser to the U.N. Special Committee on Palestine. As a correspondent for the Chicago Daily News Foreign Service said this week, Bunche is "one of the ablest, 
most likable, and most experienced men in the United Nations' Secretariat." The job he was picked for, which will take almost a year, is "just about the toughest job on the international horizon," 
the same correspondent noted. Bunche must help lead Palestine's Jews and Arabs into statehood by October 1. Currently, Bunche is the Director of the U.N. Division of Trusteeships.
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA and holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Harvard. Born in Detroit, Bunche's academic achievements are impressive:
B.A. from UCLA, 1927
A.M. from Harvard, 1928
Ph.D. from Harvard, 1934
Post-doctoral work in colonial policy and anthropology at Northwestern, the London School of Economics, and the University of Cape Town (1936-37).</text>

	<text>HE NEVER LOST HOPE
Dr. Ralph J. Bunche was the first to be greeted by the Israeli armistice delegation, with Dr. Walter Eytan and Col. Mohammed Kamel el Rahmant representing the respective parties.
At exactly 10:30 a.m., Dr. Bunche struck the table with his gavel, opening the fifth and final joint formal armistice meeting. It was a great moment for the acting 
Palestine mediator. Even he may not have been sure of success in ending the hostilities, and certainly, the prolonged negotiations did not promise a solution agreeable to all.
But Bunche worked tirelessly, showing unfailing kindness, patience, and a will to bring about peace. "He never lost hope," said the Egyptian delegate of 
the man who made peace between the vigorous young Jewish state and the mightiest of the seven Arab states which had vowed to destroy Israel only nine months before. 
Dr. Bunche’s work prompted Dr. Jessup to remark, "The United Nations should take as much pride in Bunche's victories as it does in the victories of Patton or Mark Clark." </text>

	<text>Twenty years of study and work in the area of colonial problems has made Dr. Bunche an expert. It is his first love in the thrilling, important field of dealing with world problems.
His assignment in Palestine, he looks upon as a "strange interlude." Rumors have been persistent that the brilliant Dr. Bunche would accept an offer to become an Assistant 
Secretary of State in the Truman Administration. The internationally-famed diplomat, who gave the world an example of sterling courage and resolution when he took over critical 
negotiations in Palestine after the assassination of Count Bernadotte, indicated that he would like to continue his work with the United Nations.
In the event he were offered a post in the National Government, Dr. Bunche explained, he would consider it a great honor. However, he indicated his first interest lies in 
colonial trusteeship problems and would probably remain in that field. "As a father of three children, I have a very special interest in what kind of world ours is going to be," 
he continued. An interesting sidelight on what went on behind the scenes in Palestine was revealed when we asked about the unpleasantness he encountered early in the negotiations. 
We had in mind his being charged with anti-Jewish prejudice. "I never had any trouble with the people of Palestine," he answered calmly. "I received a number of 
nasty letters last fall and right through December. They all came from New York. I never had an unpleasant note from an Arab or Jew over there. All my unpleasant mail 
came from here." "Since I was dealing with the Jews and Arabs in Palestine and only with them, the observations of people in New York who weren't directly involved in the 
situation didn't bother me," he added. Dr. Bunche is happy, however, that, in light of his handling of the situation, those who accused him of anti-Semitism are left without a leg to stand on.
One of the factors which made the Palestine assignment one of the most complicated in the history of mediation is that there were actually eight parties involved, rather than two or three.
Dr. Bunche explained that his dealings were with the Jewish state of Israel and the seven Arab states—all of whom are independent and have different policies and attitudes. 
Presently, he is involved in the last leg of the Palestine problem: negotiations with Syria. Every morning, he leaves his beautifully-appointed home in the U.N. 
development and goes to his office at the U.N. His life these days is a merry-go-round of newspapermen, photographers, well-wishers, friends, and folks who want him to 
appear on various programs. He hasn't had a vacation since 1941, going from war work to the OSS, the State Department, and finally, the U.N.</text>

	<text>Announcement of the award of the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize to Dr. Bunche, American statesman and educator, was announced in Oslo, Norway, last Friday 
by the Nobel Prize Committee of the Norwegian Parliament. The 46-year-old United Nations official, the eleventh American and first African American to be so honored, 
received the award in recognition of his work as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli war in Palestine. Dr. Bunche will receive the award in Oslo on December 19, 
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite. The United Nations official paused in the midst of a deluge of congratulations to issue a statement, in which he said:
"I received the news with deep humility, for I, more than anyone, recognize the extent to which this peace effort in the Near East flowed from the strength of the United Nations."
"In these crucial times," he added, "when the future of all mankind hangs fatefully in the balance, it is a high privilege to be associated with the work of the U.N., 
man's sole hope for peace." Dr. Bunche gave credit to the U.N., Count Folke Bernadotte, and to the U.N. observers and civil servants for the success of the Palestine mediation.
"I was in Palestine as an official of the United Nations," he said. "For five months I was the assistant of Count Folke Bernadotte, 
the great and courageous man who gave his life in the determined effort to bring peace to Palestine. It was Count Bernadotte who achieved the first truce in Palestine, 
and thereby laid the essential foundations for the armistice agreements."</text>

	<text> Bunche answers critics
Dr. Bunche Speaking to a full house at the Temple Forum series last Sunday evening, February 3, at Temple Beth Israel, 12th Avenue and East Osborn Road, Dr. Bunche told an 
eager audience that he would not mince words. After joking about his being picketed for the first time at an airport, he admitted that pickets are general the world over and are 
basically well-intentioned but ill-informed. The special assistant to the U.N. Secretary-General, U Thant, stated that he had been involved with the Congo situation during the 
last three and a half years and that his assignment was much more demanding and complex than his Palestine assignment. He is positive that peace will prevail in the Congo.
Biting heavily into his topic, "U.N. Criticisms and Prospects," Dr. Bunche assured the audience that the U.N. was at present the world's best means of avoiding total devastation. 
He added that there was no better means in the world of preventing war and working for the betterment of all. He urged the audience to reject hearsay, half-truths, and the casual
observations of prejudiced people and to judge the U.N. purely on its record—its true record.Facing the critics of the U.N. squarely, Dr. Bunche addressed the frequent criticism of Communist domination. 
He stated that there is no record in the history of the U.N. of a Communist bloc victory in voting. He noted that it was interesting that while some accused the U.N. of being 
Communist-dominated, the Communists themselves accused the U.N. of being imperialist-dominated.</text>

	<text> Bunche Speaks In State; Hits At Gov. Barnett
Jackson (UPI)—Ralph Bunche, undersecretary of the United Nations, expressed confidence Wednesday night that many white Mississippians are "not so ignorant of our national situation" as Gov. Ross Barnett.
The African American diplomat was referring to Barnett's refusal to recognize United Nations Day, which is being observed today elsewhere in the nation. Barnett feels the worldwide 
organization is dominated by integration-minded Socialists and Communists. Bunche spoke at Tougaloo College, a predominantly African American institution eight miles from the state capital, 
and commented that he was "within shouting distance of the heathens." "Nowhere are the principles upon which the United Nations was founded as sorely needed as they are in the state of Mississippi," he said.
Dozens of white students and adults joined several hundred African American students in the capacity crowd that heard Bunche at the school, which has been termed a 
"cancer" in this segregation stronghold by Mayor Allen Thompson. Bunche expressed pleasure at this instance of integration in Mississippi. He predicted that most white Southerners
would be relieved if integration were complete and racial tensions eradicated. Bunche charged that Barnett, in his fight against integration, had caused "an awful lot of harm 
to our country's image and prestige." Bunche said the United Nations is "overwhelmingly and solidly against racial discrimination" and has "sympathy for the American Negro in his 
heroic struggle for equality." However, Bunche said he did not believe the United States should make changes on the racial front simply to please other nations. Changes should be made, 
he said, because of a "moral duty." Bunche also attacked a Jackson newspaper columnist who was critical of him and the United Nations. The columnist, said Bunche, "suffers acutely 
from a malignant affliction of mind and heart known as bigotry."</text>

	<text> SWEDEN HAILS DR. RALPH BUNCHE AS NOBEL WINNER
Swedish opinion sees the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Dr. Ralph J. Bunche as an equal tribute to the late Count Folke Bernadotte, United Nations mediator for Palestine, 
whose task Dr. Bunche took over after the Count was assassinated. Count Bernadotte's widow, formerly Miss Estelle Manville of New York, who met Dr. Bunche last year when 
he made a special trip to Sweden to pay his respects, said: "Dr. Bunche really deserves the prize. He is so unbelievably human." Swedish and Norwegian Red Cross officials
who know Dr. Bunche praised him highly, an article in the New York Times said.</text>

	<text> Dr. Ralph J. Bunche is Elected Trustee of Rockefeller Foundation

by Dean Rusk, President of the Foundation. John D. Rockefeller III is chairman of the twenty-one-member board of trustees. "The interest which Dr. Bunche has shown, both through 
scholarship and public service, in the lesser developed areas will enable him," the president said, "to contribute significantly to the program of the Rockefeller Foundation, 
since much of its work concerns those areas."</text>
